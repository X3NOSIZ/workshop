# Stream a video torrent

Write a script that downloads the film [Sintel](https://webtorrent.io/torrents/sintel.torrent) and streams it into a `<video>` tag.

## Tips

Torrents can contain multiple files, so it's important to select the file we want to use. We want the `.mp4` file since we're trying to play the video.

Add code to your `'ready'` handler to select the `.mp4` file from the `torrent.files` array. Finally, display it in the page.

```js
torrent.on('ready', () => {
  // ...previous code...

  // Torrents can contain many files. Let's use the .mp4 file
  const file = torrent.files.find(file => file.name.endsWith('.mp4'))

  // Display the file by adding it to the DOM
  file.appendTo('body', { muted: true, autoplay: true })
})
```

The argument to `appendTo` is a CSS selector that describes an element on the page. So, `'body'` represents the HTML `<body>` tag that is present in all HTML pages.

Notice how we set the video to autoplay, but we also muted it by default so the browser will not block it for making audio without user interaction.

To learn more about the `appendTo` API, [read the docs](https://webtorrent.io/docs).

## Verify

If it worked, you should see the film "Sintel" start to play back! You just played back your first torrent in the browser with WebTorrent!
