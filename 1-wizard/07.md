## Tips

We recommend browsing the [WebTorrent docs](https://webtorrent.io/docs) and [WebTorrent FAQ](https://webtorrent.io/faq) to get an idea of what else you can do with WebTorrent.

Spend some time playing around with WebTorrent and see what else you can do! Get those creative juices flowing. What's something cool that you can build with the power of torrents in your web browser?

If you build something cool, please share it with us on Twitter [@WebTorrentApp](https://twitter.com/WebTorrentApp) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/cnXkm4Z). We love to share and promote the things created by the amazing WebTorrent community -- and now that you've completed this workshop, that includes you!
