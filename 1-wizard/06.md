# 6 - Create a download link for each file in the torrent

Write a script that downloads the torrent [The WIRED CD](https://webtorrent.io/torrents/wired-cd.torrent) and displays a download link for each file in the torrent.

## Tips

Use the `file.getBlobURL()` function to get a URL which can be used to link to the file in the torrent. You can use this as the `href` in a link that you add to the page.

For each file in the torrent, run the following code:

```js
file.getBlobURL(function (err, url) {
  // If there was an error, print it in the console
  if (err) throw err

  // Create a link element
  const a = document.createElement('a')
  a.href = url
  a.textContent = 'Download ' + file.name
  a.style.display = 'block'

  // Tell browser to download the file when link is clicked, using the given name
  a.download = file.name

  // Add the link to the page
  document.body.appendChild(a)
})
```

To learn more about the `getBlobURL` API, [read the docs](https://webtorrent.io/docs).
