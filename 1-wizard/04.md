# 04 - Stream a music album

Write a script that downloads the torrent [The WIRED CD](https://webtorrent.io/torrents/wired-cd.torrent), which is a Creative Commons album released by WIRED Magazine in 2004. Display all the album's tracks in the page as `<audio>` tags.

(You can read about [The WIRED CD on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wired_CD), if you're interested.)

## Tips

Start by swapping out the `torrentId` in your code with the following magnet link:

```js
const torrentId = 'https://webtorrent.io/torrents/wired-cd.torrent'
```

Next, you should select all the `.mp3` files in the torrent by using the `filter` function. It works just like `find` but it selects multiple files.

Finally, add each selected file to the page.

```js
torrent.on('ready', () => {
  const files = torrent.files.filter(file => file.name.endsWith('.mp3'))

  files.forEach(file => {
    file.appendTo('body')
  })
})
```

## Verify

If it worked, you should see an `<audio>` tag added to the page for each track in The WIRED CD. WebTorrent can handle any kind of media file that is supported by the browser!
