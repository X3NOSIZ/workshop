# Use magnet links

Write a script that downloads the film [Sintel](https://webtorrent.io/torrents/sintel.torrent) using a magnet link, rather than a torrent file, and streams it into a `<video>` tag.

## Tips

You can identify a torrent in many ways. WebTorrent support the following ways:

- http/https url to a torrent file (string) (WE USED THIS ALREADY)
- magnet uri (string)
- torrent file (buffer)
- info hash (hex string or buffer)
- parsed torrent (from parse-torrent)
- filesystem path to a torrent file (string) (Node.js only)

Try swapping out the `torrentId` in your code with the following magnet link:

```js
const torrentId = 'magnet:?xt=urn:btih:08ada5a7a6183aae1e09d831df6748d566095a10&dn=Sintel&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fexplodie.org%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.empire-js.us%3A1337&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337&tr=wss%3A%2F%2Ftracker.btorrent.xyz&tr=wss%3A%2F%2Ftracker.fastcast.nz&tr=wss%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openwebtorrent.com&ws=https%3A%2F%2Fwebtorrent.io%2Ftorrents%2F&xs=https%3A%2F%2Fwebtorrent.io%2Ftorrents%2Fsintel.torrent'
```

## Verify

If it worked, you should see the film "Sintel" start to play back! There's no difference between the way WebTorrent handles torrent files or magnet links!
